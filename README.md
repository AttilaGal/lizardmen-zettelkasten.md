## Note to Visitors (12/9/2020)

I haven't had the time to actively maintain the theme for everyone. But I only fix issues with it as needed for me to work with my own vault because it is the theme that I use on a daily basis. So I apologize if there is something funky about it. I uploaded the latest version from my personal vault. 

# Lizardmen Zettelkasen for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)
